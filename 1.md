## Problem 1

If $s_1,s_2, s_3$ are the sums of $n, 2n, 3n$ terms respectively of an arithmetical progression, shew that $s_3 = 3 (s_2 â€” s_1)$

## Solution

Let the terms of the arithmetic progression be $a, a+d, a+2d, ..., a+(n-1)d, .... , a+(2n-1)d, ...a+(3n-1)d$

Sum of the first $k$ terms is

  $ sigma = a+(a+d)+(a+2d)+...+(a+(k-1)d) = ka + d(1+2+3+4+5...k-1) = ka+d(k-1)k/2$

So 
/begin{align}
  s_2-s_1 & = 2na+(2n-1)2n/2 - (na+(n-1)n/2) 
          & = na+(4n^2-2n-n^2+n)/2
          & = na+(3n^2-n)/2 
          & = na+(3n-1)n/2
/end{align}
So $3(s_2-s_1) = 3na + (3n-1)3n/2 $ which is the same as subsituiting $3n$ for $k$ in the formula above
