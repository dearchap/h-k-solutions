## Problem
If $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are the imaginary cube roots of unity, shew that 

$$\alpha^4+\beta^4+\alpha^{-1}\beta^{-1}=0$$

## Solution

Since $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are the imaginary cube roots of unity, they are the roots of the equation
$$x^2+x+1=$$
This implies that $\alpha+\beta=-1$ , $\alpha\beta=1$ and also $\alpha^3=\beta^3=1$


$$\begin{align}\alpha^4+\beta^4+\alpha^{-1}\beta^{-1}&=\alpha\alpha^3+\beta\beta^3+\alpha^{-1}\beta^{-1} \\
     & = (\alpha + \beta) + \alpha^{-1}\beta^{-1} \\
     & = (-1) + (1) = 0 \end{align}$$
